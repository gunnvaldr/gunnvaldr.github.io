Aside from programming and whatnot, I also enjoy gaming.  Here's what I've been playing lately in no particular order.

## Dragon Quest Builders 2

This game was a surprise to me.  There is a free demo available and I never played the first game but I was hooked from the moment I started it.  I played Minecraft when it first was a thing years and years ago but haven't touched these types of games in a **long** time.

You play as a "builder" in a world where building is against the law.  I sunk about 50 hours into the main story which has you travelling from island to island recruiting various people (and monsters!) to help you rebuild what has been destroyed.  The game is a *bit* hand-holdy, and you don't unlock everything until the end, but it's a blast from start to finish.

## Fire Emblem: Three Houses

I just picked this up recently and haven't had a lot of time with it yet.  My first and only Fire Emblem experience was with the first Game Boy Advance game released in the early 2000's (I think?) and I haven't been back to the series since.

From what I've played so far it seems very, **very** complex and I look forward to really digging into it.

## Rogue Legacy

I purchased this game years ago for the PlayStation Vita and remembered having an absolute blast with it.  It's one of the only "rogue-likes" that has ever captured my interest and time.  The map is *just* large enough to keep it varied and entertaining and the progression system is top-notch.

I've only died a billion times, and have only beaten two of the castle's (four?) bosses, but it keeps sucking me back in.  I really like playing in the lich class with some blood armor/runes.

## The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim

I've sunk hundreds of hours into this game on both PC and now Switch and there's not much I can say that hasn't been said about this game already but thousands of other people.  I really think it is a Bethesda masterpiece.

On my most recent play-through I completed the Dark Brotherhood and Thieves Guild quests.  I'm working through the vampire/werewolf DLC at the moment for the first time but other games (namely the previously mentioned Dragon Quest Builders 2) caught my attention and I haven't been back to Skyrim yet.

## What I play on

I own all platforms and jump around depending on what my mood fits.  Currently that is almost exclusively the Nintendo Switch as the portable nature of it is incredibly convenient for me.  Last year I played a ton of PS4 as they have a lot of exclusives that are incredibly good.  Horizon Zero Dawn, God of War, The Last of Us to name a few.

## Looking forward

Games on my radar at the moment include the Switch release of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and the remake of Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening.
