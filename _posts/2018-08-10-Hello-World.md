:+1: It's working great so far. Writing markdown and generating static pages seems so much nicer, simpler, and easier than heavy JavaScript solutions. Plus I don't have to deal with something like [this](https://www.google.com/search?q=javascript+fatigue)!

I don't exactly know what I'm going to be posting here, this is mostly a proof-of-concept for me, but here goes!
