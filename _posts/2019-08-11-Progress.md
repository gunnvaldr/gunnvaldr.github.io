I've made some progress with this experiment today.

<!--more-->

- Added a [Privacy Policy]({{ site.baseurl }}/privacy).
  - Along with this, updated the Google Analytics script to be more compliant and friendly.
- Fixed the favicon.
- Wrote a [new post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _posts/2019-08-11-on-games.md %}) about something other than Jekyll :smile:
- Cleaned up some of the CSS template.
- Optimized more of the site using [Google's Lighthouse tool](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/){:target="_blank"}.
- Fixed a bug on the "estimated reading time" feature

I'm finding this experiment pretty interesting so far.  It's amazing how simple and effective Jeykll+GitHub is without relying on heavy JavaScript or databases.
