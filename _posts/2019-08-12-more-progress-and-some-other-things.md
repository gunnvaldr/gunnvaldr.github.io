I really only did some minor updates today with this project, and a "major" new feature I added last night.

<!--more-->

## Today
- Replaced Google Analytics with Google Tag Manager
  - this has an added effect of reducing an "include" when I build on Jekyll, decreasing build time
- Minor tweaks to links around the site to open external pages in a new window/tab

## Last Night
- Added day/night mode toggle
  - you can see/use this in the upper-left of any page on the site

Other than that I worked on some other projects, and made some minor adjustments to an IRC client I use, [thelounge](https://thelounge.chat){:target="_blank"}.

It's a hot day here :fire: so about to cool off with a bottle of wine by the pool!
